This research Project searches to determine the abilities of a Naive-Bayes Classifier to be able to determine the genre of a song when given only the lyrics as a list of words. For this work, songs from the genres of Rock, Country, Rap, Pop, and Dance are used for training and testing the model. Two Naive-Bayes Classifiers are trained: the first using every word from every song in the training data and the second using only the 1000 most common non-stop words from the corpus. The better of the two was able to reach an overall accuracy of 39.4%. Also discussed in this project is the issue of overpredicting that can present itself.}
